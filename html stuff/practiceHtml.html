     <pre> 
        the pre element 
        maintains


        all the spacing and         weird stuff we do , so put things inbetween pre if you need to maintain space and stuff

     </pre>
 <p> you can also set and change styles with the style element</p>


<p> here ive set the background color to darkblue </p>
<p style="background-color:purple;" > you can also send the background color for indivdual things using the style tag</p>
<h6 style="background-color:rosybrown;"> you can also change the background color for headers too :o</h6>

<h2 style="color:pink"> you can also set text color individually with the style tag <br> like how we did it above :o</h2>

<p> Heres a line from one of my favourite characters <b style="color:red "> Roland </b> </p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofruina/comments/mq4du7/o_sorrow/#:~:text=O%20sorrow%2C%20I%20have%20ended,attempt%20to%20enter%20my%20heart.%22">
   <i> I have nothing but my sorrow, and I want nothing more. It has been, it still is, faithful to me.

Why should I begrudge it, since during the hours, when my soul crushed the depths of my heart, it was seated there beside me?

O sorrow, I have ended, you see, by respecting you, because I am certain you will never leave me. Ah, I realize it: your beauty lies in the force of your being.

Because I know that on the day of my final agony, you will be there, lying in my sheets, O sorrow, so that you might once again attempt to enter my heart." </i>
<br> - Francis Jammes

<p> i like this quote because <q> sometimes sorrow can be a really hard thing to escape.</q> <br> -Delano</p>

<p style="border: 2px solid tomato;"> you can even put boarders around text , this works for headings </p>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(162, 36 ,65);"> you can also use rgb too to make headings  </h2>
